Allure:
- To get allure report you need to have allure installed and the following commands in terminal should be run:
    run tests: 'pytest --alluredir="directory_to_store_allure_files"
    open html report: allure serve "directory_to_store_allure_files"
- To save allure results running tests using pycharm test runner you need to set to Additional Arguments --alluredir="directory_to_store_allure_files"

Pytest:
- To run tests in parallel add -n={number_of_threads} to your pytest command. Logging doesn't support parallel run, so it
will be hard to read them. But logs in allure work fine.
- There 2 marks for tests ui - for test that require browser and api - for test with api actions only
